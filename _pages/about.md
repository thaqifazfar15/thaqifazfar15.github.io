I’m an undergraduate student in Computational Data Sciences at Penn State Harrisburg, with a strong interest in the intersection of mathematics, machine learning and physics.

I'm interested in algebraic geometry and numerical analysis. I enjoy exploring how abstract mathematical ideas can be used to solve real-world problems, especially through computation. I'm still learning, but I’m excited by the way pure and applied math connect in areas like data science and scientific computing.

I'm currently looking for research opportunities to learn more and gain hands-on experience. Feel free to reach out!
